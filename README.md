## Personal notes while learning Go

This is a random collection of small Go programs that demonstrate building
blocks I was researching while learning the Go language.

Primarily for my own notes, but happy to share for your interest :)

### Build

Build the programs and screencasts via

```console
git clone https://github.com/dennisklein/go-lessons
cd go-lessons
docker buildx bake
```

Build artifacts are written to `_out/`.
